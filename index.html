  <h3>Books of Inspiration</h3>
  <p> The books I have listed below include links to author information and quotes that inspired me to trust myself and cope with the loss of my first and greatest love, Florence. A part of me died when I lost Florence. The best part of me was, and still is Her. My experience in love revealed challenging decisions that I made during a time of overwhelming grief and despair. I saw something that said, "the greatest loss is what dies inside of us while we live"; my loss was sudden, unexpected, and has left a bottomless pit of emptiness in my heart, and it is forever burned in my memory. My lesson in love is God's greatest gift to me; and I am forever changed. I thank God, the moon, and the stars for what heartbreak has taught me. I know My Florence is safe, healthy, and happy. There is not a day that goes by where I don't think of Florence or that I am reminded of Her. I don't know everything but, I know a lot more now. </p>

      <li> "Understanding is the essence of love. If you cannot understand, you cannot love. That is the message of the Buddha. If a husband, for example, does not understand his wifeâ€™s deepest troubles, her deepest aspirations, if he does not understand her suffering, he will not be able to love her in the right way. Without understanding, love is an impossible thing. What must we do in order to understand a person? We must have time; we must practice looking deeply into this person. We must be there, attentive; we must observe, we must look deeply. And the fruit of this looking deeply is called understanding. Love is a true thing if it is made up of a substance called understanding. The second element of true love is compassion, karuna. This is not only the desire to ease the pain of another person, but the ability to do so. You must practice deep looking in order to gain a good understanding of the nature of the suffering of this person, in order to be able to help him or her to change. Knowledge and understanding are always at the root of the practice."..."If there is no joy in love, it is not true love. If you are suffering all the time, if you cry all the time, and if you make the person you love cry, this is not really loveâ€”it is even the opposite. If there is no joy in your love, you can be sure that it is not true love."</li>

      <li>"God has not been trying an experiment on my faith or love in order to find out their quality. He knew it already. It was I who didn't. In this trial He makes us occupy the dock, the witness box, and the bench all at once. He always knew that my temple was a house of cards. His only way of making me realize the fact was to knock it down."</li>
      <li>"Her absense is like the sky, spread over everything."</li>
      <li>"...From the garden to the Gardener, from the sword to the Smith. To the life-giving Life and the beauty that makes it beautiful. 'She is in God's hands.' That gains a new energy when I think of her as a sword"...Now perhaps He grasps the hilt; weighs the new weapon; makes lightenings with it in the air."</li>
